# Simple Linear Regression: Mean Honey Production per Year

![Honeycomb](honeycomb.jpg)

A simple Linear Regression performed on the mean production of honey per year, 
on the dataset [Honey Production in the USA (1998 - 2012)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/honey-production) .

The model was calculated using the [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) 
library, after that the assumptions where verified and in conclusion the 
resulting model summarized.

The [Stats 500 Course of the Pennsylvania State University, Eberly College of Science](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat500/lesson/9/9.2/9.2.3)
served as a guideline for acomplishing this task.
